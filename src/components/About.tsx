            <h3 className="h3">ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>I have always been passionate about 
                math and the sciences, which led me 
                to pursue a degree in Electrical 
                Engineering. For 8 years, 
                from 2014 to 2022, I worked as a professional 
                writer with companies like iWriter and 
                Edarabia, a Saudi Arabian-based content
                creation company, while also collaborating
                with international clients. However, 
                after reaching my peak as a writer, 
                I transitioned into IT and tech two 
                years ago.
            </p>
            
            <p>I joined an intense, 
                one-year software engineering 
                program where I trained in 
                full-stack development, ultimately 
                specializing as a frontend developer.
                Today, I am passionate about 
                technology and continuous learning. 
                I work with React, TypeScript/JavaScript,
                Node, Express.js, Firebase, 
                and React Native for mobile 
                development, focusing on building 
                web and mobile systems that drive 
                change. Additionally, as a Web3 
                developer, I work with the Cosmos 
                SDK and Cosmos.js library to build 
                decentralized applications (dApps).
            </p>

                <p>My long-term goal is to become 
                    a top-tier software developer 
                    and eventually transition into 
                    cybersecurity, specializing in 
                    offensive security and penetration
                    testing. When Iâ€™m not coding or 
                    learning, I enjoy playing chess 
                    to sharpen my strategic thinking 
                    and because it's fun!.
